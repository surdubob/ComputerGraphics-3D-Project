# 3D Project - Computer Graphics
This project was developed for the Computer Graphics 3rd year course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bucharest.
The project consists of a 3D scene built with OpenGl and Glut in C++, and has the following features:
- A lake with a random contour generated using Bezier Curves each time the program starts
- Grass surrounding the lake
- A boat generated using mathematical functions
- Randomly generated fish in the lake
- Randomly generated houses, trees and mountains around the lake
